Even now he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon. You are all going to die! But you know this don't you Gandalf? You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile, crept from the shadows will never be crowned King.Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those who are closest to him' those he professes to love! Tell me, what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead to death.",The Return of the King

252,Legolas,"One that is cursed. Long ago the men of the mountains swore an oath to the last King of Gondor, to come to his aid, to fight. But when the time came, when Gondor's need was dire, they fled vanishing into the darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them, never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.

342,Eomer,"You know as little of war as that Hobbit. When the fear takes him, and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold. Do you think he would stand and fight? He would flee. And he would be right to do so. War is the province of men Eowyn.",The Return of the King

395,Pippin,"Well, I'm taller than you were then. Though, I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.",The Return of the King
396,Faramir,"It never fitted me either. Boromir was always the soldier. They were so alike he and my father. Proud, stubborn even, but strong.",The Return of the King

439,Sam,"No. No you're not all right, you're exhausted. It's that Gollum. It's this place. It's that thing around your neck. I could help a bit.

475,Denethor,"What you judged to be right! You sent the Ring of power into Mordor in the hands of a witless Halfling! It should have been brought back to the citadel to be kept safe. Hidden. Dark and deep in the vaults' not to be used. unless, at the uttermost end of need.",The Return of the King
479,Denethor,"And why should your songs be unfit for my halls? Come, sing me a song.",The Return of the King
480,Pippin,"Home is behind, The world ahead, And there are many paths to tread, Through shadow, to the edge of night, Until the stars are all alight. Mist and shadow cloud and shade, All shall fade, All shall, 'fade.",The Return of the King
481,Orcs,"March, march! March, march march!",The Return of the King
485,Sam,"I wonder if people will ever say, ""Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."" And they'll say, ""Yes! That's one of my favourite stories."" ""Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad? "" ""Yes, my boy.The most famousest of Hobbits. And that's saying a lot."",",The Two Towers

506,Gollum,"Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has Smeagol ever done to him? Master? Master carries a heavy burden Smeagol knows, heavy heavy burden. Fat one cannot know. He wants it. He needs it.

648,Frodo,"I can't do this, Sam.",The Two Towers
649,Sam,"I know. It's all wrong.By rights, we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.Full of darkness and danger they were.

651,Sam Voiceover,"But in the end, it's only a passing thing...... this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.

Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over. The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many",The Fellowship of the Ring
2224,Gandalf,"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought. Oh! Its that way",The Fellowship of the Ring

2255,Eowyn,"I dreamed I saw a great wave climbing over green lands and above the hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet. A light shone behind me but I could not turn, I could only stand there, waiting.",The Return of the King

2275,Gandalf,"They have taken the Bridge and the second hall. We have barred the gates, but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes. Drums, Drums in the deep. We cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. We cannot get out. They are coming.",The Fellowship of the Ring
2276,Gandalf,"Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity!",The Fellowship of the Ring
2281,Barliman,"He's one of them rangers. They're dangerous folk they are. Wandering the wilds. What his right name is, I've never heard, but round here, he's known as Strider.",The Fellowship of the Ring
2284,Pippin,"Baggins? Sure I know a Baggins! He's over there. Frodo Baggins! He's my second cousin once removed on his mother's side, and my third cousin twice removed on his father's side, if you follow me.",The Fellowship of the Ring

2301,Bilbo,"They're after the house! They've never forgiven me for living this long. I've got to get away from these confounded relatives hanging on the bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace. I want to see mountains again, mountains Gandalf. And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea!",The Fellowship of the Ring
2303,Bilbo,"Yes, yes, it's all in hand. All the arrangements are made. Oh, thank you.",The Fellowship of the Ring

2331,Strider,"They were once men. Great Kings of Men. The Sauron the Deciever gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed they took them without question.

2338,Bilbo,"Yes, yes.",The Fellowship of the Ring
2340,Bilbo,"I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I think in his heart Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods, the fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. I feel thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday, a very long holiday.

2349,Gan Dalf,"His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing. He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth, Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough, perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground, before he sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit Rohan must be ready for war.",The Return of the King
2362,Pippin,"What about elvenses? Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, Dinner? Supper! He knows about them, doesnt he?",The Fellowship of the Ring
